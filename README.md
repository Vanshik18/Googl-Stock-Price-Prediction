# Googl-Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock Price Prediction tends to be a challenging task due to market volatility and influence of various external factors including environment, politics and the regulations made by SEBI. The project is made to develop an ML model for predicting the closing stock prices of Google (GOOGL) using various ML models. I have utilized financial news, social media, and Kaggle for key inputs such as Historical Stock Data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis. The various ML models used for stock price prediction are ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, and Facebook Prophet. Multiple models are being tested for higher accuracy of the results. Data pre-processing, feature selection, and model optimization techniques have been implemented for performance enhancement. 
The results demonstrate that advanced ML/DL models can provide valuable insights, assisting investors in making informed trading decisions. 
However, the project acknowledges the limitations of unpredictability in stock markets and the need for continuous model refinement.
